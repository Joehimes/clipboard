## Overview

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I created this website using a mobile-first process. I designed the entire site to look great on a Iphone 12 screen. I then moved on to a full-size desktop size. I found this to be much easier to fine-tune than working backwards to a smaller screen.

### Continued development

This project was only completed using HTML and CSS. I hope to update this in the future with some JavaScript elements to give it a more interactive feel.
